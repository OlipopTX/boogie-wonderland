# Boogie Wonderland 💃🏽

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into cloud computing, AI, and data analytics — a sandbox where I practice, polish, and share progress as I transition from science education into the tech world.

## 🛠️ What's Inside

> Coming soon: Sample projects involving:
- SQL exemplars with JOINs, filters, subqueries, and aggregation
- Python notebooks for AI/ML experimentation
- AWS deployment tests and cloud automation workflows

## 🧑‍🎓 Purpose

To build a public portfolio that demonstrates my skill acquisition in:
- SQL & database structure
- Cloud technologies (AWS)
- Git/GitHub version control
- Foundational AI tools

## 🧭 Navigation Notes

Right now this is a holding repo — think of it as the **club getting set up before the crowd arrives**.
As I complete certifications and projects, I'll update this README and repo with:
- Proper subfolders per skill
- Project links
- Technical documentation
