# Boogie Wonderland

This repository contains SQL practice and demonstration queries as part of my learning journey into cloud computing, data analytics, and AI. It serves as a sandbox where I practice, polish, and share progress as I transition from science education into the tech world.

## Features

* SQL exemplars with joins, filters, subqueries, and aggregation
* Python notebooks for AI and machine learning experimentation
* AWS deployment tests and cloud automation workflows

## Setup


Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/OliPopTX/boogie-wonderland.git`

Then open the SQL files with your preferred SQL environment. For Python notebooks (if included), create a virtual environment and install the required packages.
