# Plan.md

## Current state
* Repository consists of SQL examples and demonstration queries, with a directory for SQL practice and several .sql files.
* README includes emojis and decorative icons, which may not appear professional to recruiters.
* There is no license file, so the repository has no stated license.
* There are no continuous integration or code quality checks configured.
* Branch protection is not set on the main branch.

## Recommended improvements
1. Add a `LICENSE` file using the MIT license to clarify open source usage.
2. Rewrite the `README.md` to use a clear title, a concise project summary, and a list of features using plain markdown lists without emojis or hyphens. Include sections for setup and usage where appropriate and a license notice.
3. Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` GitHub Actions workflow that runs on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch. For a SQL repository without automated tests, the workflow can run a placeholder command, ensuring that future checks can be added easily.
4. Enable Dependabot alerts and GitHub Actions security features via the repository settings.
5. Configure branch protection rules on the `main` branch to require pull requests and CI checks.

This plan is intended to make the repository look polished and professional to recruiters while establishing a foundation for future enhancements.
